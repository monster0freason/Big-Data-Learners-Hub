Data-Engineering-Showcase

An open-source collection of real-world data engineering mini-projects. This repository serves as a learning hub for aspiring and current data engineers to practice their skills, experiment with different technologies, and contribute to a growing library of data solutions.
üöÄ About This Project

Inspired by training exercises for Big Data professionals, the goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on learning environment. The projects are designed to be small enough to be approachable but complex enough to cover key concepts in data engineering, from data ingestion and cleaning to storage optimization and analysis.

This is a community-driven project. We strongly encourage you to contribute your own solutions, optimizations, and even new project ideas!
üìÇ The Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects, each in its own directory. Each project includes a dataset and a set of problems or tasks to be solved.

    Credit Card Transactions Analysis: Analyze credit card transaction data to uncover spending patterns and fraud.

    E-commerce Project: Work with e-commerce data to understand customer behavior and sales performance.

    Olympic Data Analysis: Dive into historical Olympic data to find interesting statistics and insights.

    OTT Recommendation Analysis: Analyze data from an OTT (Over-the-Top) platform to build simple recommendation logic.

    Real Estate Analysis: Analyze real estate data to understand market trends.

    Retail Sales Analysis: Work with retail sales data to track performance and identify key metrics.
